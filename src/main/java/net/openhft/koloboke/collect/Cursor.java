/**
 * A mutable pointer to the element in an iteration. {@code Cursor} is a kind of hybrid between
 * Java standard {@link Iterator} interface and

 *     {@code System.Collections.IEnumerator}</a> interface from .NET framework.
 *
 * <p>{@code Cursor} interface design typically permits slightly faster implementation,
 * than {@link Iterator}, so it is preferred in performance-critical code.
 * On the other hand, isn't supported by Java's "for-each" syntax.
 *
 * <p>See the <a href="{@docRoot}/overview-summary.html#iteration">comparison of iteration ways</a>
 * in the library.

 * <p>Cursors of updatable and immutable containers don't support {@link #remove()} operation.
